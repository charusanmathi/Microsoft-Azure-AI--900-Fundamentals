# Microsoft-Azure-AI--900-Fundamentals
This is a one stop repository of resources for Microsoft AI-900 Fundamentals Exam.


Here is my FAIL PROOF GUIDELINE on how to clear the exam! 

1. Free resources from Microsoft : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/
         This includes theory and labs, the labs are helpful to get an overall understanding of how various Azure AI services work. 99% of the questions were from the theory  sections of this free resource 

2. Practice tests from udemy : https://www.udemy.com/course/ai-900-microsoft-azure-ai-fundamentals-practice-tests-new/                                  There are 5 practice tests from Aman Goswami and they have 70-75% of the exact same questions that appear in the exam. I took these exams multiple times until i scored 100% in all of them. 

3. Practice assessment from Microsoft: Microsoft themselves offer unlimited practice tests on their website for AI-900. I took these exams mutiple turns until I scored over 95%. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/practice/assessment

4. What’s not covered in the above materials : Generative AI questions predominantly appeared in the exam. Most of these was not covered in any of the above resources as much as it appeared in exam. 

1. Focus on these : Parameters for hypertuning LLM’s like Temperature, Max Response, Verbose , Diveristy of token generated. 
2. Lot of questions on GPT3.5 and chatbots 
3. Question on transformer models 

5. John Savill’s AI-900 summary on YouTube for those who do not have a the time to read the Microsoft theory and labs. He has two videos : AI-900 and generative Ai, highly recommend both

NON MANDATORY RESOURCES:

1. App Store on iPhone has a AI-900 quiz app which is paid but it has 200 questions and test can be taken as many times. 50-60% questions came from here too. App name: Azure AI-900 exam April 2024 
2. I will share PDF  of the most common occurring questions and theory summary document. I did read the pdf but not the theory summary as I had my own notes form Microsoft learn. 
3. This is another website with comprehensive reading material and questions https://pupuweb.com/microsoft-azure-ai-fundamentals-ai900-actual-exam-question-answer-dumps-6/
